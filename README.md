# Web seminar

Web seminar I created as an university project.

Content is written in Croatian, but you are free to use any elements of the
website for your own projects. Beware that common.css file is likely not
complete and only contains styling for elements used by the website.

I created two different layouts for this website. As I didn't like the first
one, I replaced it with the current one. Example of the first layout can be
accessed by pressing CTRL + ALT + O on index.html (in Firefox), or by manually
accessing old.html file. HTML and CSS for old layout can be found in
part/layoutOld.html and style/layoutOld.css files respectively.

I use a custom JS script for loading layouts which can be found in
script/layout.js. It heavily relies on jQuery.
